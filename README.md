# Welcome to your Training Day!

# Task

The company SicroMoft needs a MESSAGE BROKER SOFTWARE to asynchronosly process news articles. The company decided to use RABBITMQ for that and needs you to set up a RABBITMQ-CLUSTER with three servers. In order to test it properly the cluster has to be set up as VMs on a local machine with the help of an automation tool like ansible, so it can always be build from scratch automatically.

IMPORTANT: We provide a Laptop having Ubuntu installed on it. You will find ansible, vagrant and virtual-box preinstalled as well. However, you are free to choose different tools, if you like.
